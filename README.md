Hello World!
Welcome to ML

 Caution: This mini project is my first hands on experience in the field, and should be considered far from being perfect.

The Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification, with only a few minor differences. However, the main idea is always the same: to minimize error, individualizing the hyperplane which maximizes the margin, keeping in mind that part of the error is tolerated.




The repository contains an implementation of non-linear support vector regression,
using Gaussian kernel, without using any library except c++ STL, for better understanding of the method.

The aim is to predict next year rainfall based on previous year data. 
The dataset has been made available by Government of India and can be found at the following link: https://data.gov.in/catalog/district-rainfall-normal-mm-monthly-seasonal-and-annual-data-period-1951-2000
a copy is included here as the CSV file.


IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
A model is trained is trained for each state, for each state to predict the upcoming year rainfall.

Method used:
1.    Data preprocessing:            
        The missing data points are filled by the average rainfall of the month for the given state.
        Then the data matrix is prepared by normalising the columns of the matrix, month by month.
        Then a feature matrix is generated using the Gaussian kernel, for further analysis purpose.

2.    Training of SVR:
        The SVR is trained by gradient decent, with proper normalisation.
        The trained model is then used to predict the next year rainfall and value is returned as a list, month-wise, consecutively.
3.    Visualizing data:
        A python source file is also included for graphical plotting of the data provided and predicted value.
